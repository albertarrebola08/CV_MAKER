# CV MAKER
## Description


<li>This is an exercise from the second year of Interactive Communication (my university degree). 
<li>Essentially, I have created the front-end interface and populated it with information retrieved from MySQL using PHP and SQL queries. 
<li>The goal was to make it an interactive and dynamic website so that users can create their own CV with their personal information while adhering to a predefined structure."
